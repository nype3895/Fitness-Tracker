Hot Girl Tracker – Fitness App Design

For this assignment, I designed a fitness app called Hot Girl Tracker, aimed at helping users get ready for summer. Using Figma, I focused on creating a female-friendly interface by incorporating pink icons and implementing a dark mode for a sleek, modern aesthetic.

One of the key features of my design is animated workout transitions—as users click through different workout options, the screen smoothly shifts between lifting, running, cycling, and yoga. This was a great opportunity for me to practice Figma components, a skill I initially struggled with in Spencer’s UI project but successfully applied here.

Additionally, I added a GIF to the steps tracker to enhance user engagement. The tracker first displays the daily step count, but when clicked, it plays a fun little animation of footprints walking, making the experience more interactive.

This project helped me refine my UI/UX skills, improve my understanding of components in Figma, and experiment with dynamic elements to create a more engaging fitness experience.![HotGirl Tracker APP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/995a355a-d78e-415b-9c3b-59d36a3c16a6)
